# React Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/muneneevans/react-js-bolierplate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muneneevans/react-js-bolierplate)


This is a simple, opinionated boilerplate to help quickly setup a react-redux appliaction

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Many of the boilerplate insprirations were drawn from this [article](https://hackernoon.com/redux-step-by-step-a-simple-and-robust-workflow-for-real-life-apps-1fdf7df46092)

### Prerequisites

* npm
* node js

### Installing

clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/muneneevans/react-js-bolierplate.git
```

install node modules

```
npm install
```

## Tools
The recommended editor for this is VS CODE with these extensions
* [ES-Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
* [Chrome debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
react-js-boilerplate/
    public/
        build/
            main.js
            main.css
        index.html
    node_modules/
    src/
        Components/
        Containers/
        Services/
        Store/
            confitureStore.js
            rootReducer.js
        app.css
        index.html
        index.js
    package.json
    readme.md
    webpack.config.js
```

## Running the tests

run test

```
npm test
```

## Buidling the project

run build

```
npm start
```

## Adding Actions/ActionTypes/Reducer/Selectors

The store is split up into domains as follow

```
Store/
    Domain1/
        actionTypes.js
        actions.js
        reducer.js
        selectors.js
    Domain2/
        actionTypes.js
        actions.js
        reducer.js
        selectors.js
    configureStore.js
    rootReducer.js
```

Example

```
Store/
    Posts/
        actionTypes.js
        actions.js
        reducer.js
        selectors.js
    Comments/
        actionTypes.js
        actions.js
        reducer.js
        selectors.js
    configureStore.js
    rootReducer.js
```

## Combining reducers

All reducers are combined in the rootReducer

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

import domain1Reducer from "./Domain1/reducer";
import domain2Reducer from "./Domain2/reducer";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  domain1Reducer,
  domain2Reducer
});

export default rootReducer;
```

## Configure the Store

The configureStore.js is already configured to accept the root reducer as the default store
